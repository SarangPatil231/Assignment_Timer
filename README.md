Project Name - Timer-app
Auther - Sarang Patil.

Project Overview
I have created a React web app with a single page divided into two sections: the left side displays a list of timers in this list the date when the timer started and the timer count down, and the right side contains a form to add new timers. Each timer shows the creation time and a countdown timer updates every 10 milliseconds. Timers are removed automatically when they expire, and the user can also manually delete a timer.

Create a new react project app name timer-app.
use command - npx create-react-app timer-app.

create components Timer and TimerForm
Timer - this is the left side of the app which displays a list of timers.
TimerForm - this is the right side of the app and contains a form to add new timers.

State Management:-
useState - Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it.
useEffect - Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code.

Styling
Add basic CSS to style the components and layout CSS in the App.css file.
follow proper naming conventions and use selectors.
import this in all components.

Summary
Setup: Create a React project using the Create React App.
Components: Create Timer and TimerForm components.
