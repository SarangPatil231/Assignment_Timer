Auther - Sarang Patil.

Project Overview
I have created a React web app with a single page divided into two sections: the left side displays a list of timers in this list the date when timer started and timer count down, and the right side contains a form to add new timers. Each timer shows the creation time and a countdown timer that updates every 10 milliseconds. Timers are removed automatically when they expire, and the user can also manually delete a timer.
